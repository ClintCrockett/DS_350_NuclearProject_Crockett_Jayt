# DS_350_NuclearProject_Crockett_Jayt
This is a recreation of a school project because the link between Github and Rstudio broke.

We will be working with Rstudio and data visulization tools to learn how to create graphs to present information.



Final Project 
This project explores the financial performance, volatility, and risk characteristics of major U.S. investment financial firms, primarily JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS). The goal is to produce a clear, visualization driven analysis that shows how these financial firms behave over time and what insights potential investors or analysts can draw from the data. This aligns directly with my career interest in financial analytics, especially because I am considering working for JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs in the future.

Questions: 
1. How have JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs performed over the past several years?
(Trends, growth, drawdowns)

2. Which financial firm shows more volatility and risk?
(Comparing daily return variability)

3. Which financial firm offers better risk adjusted returns?
(Using the Sharpe Ratio)

4. How did major events like COVID-19 and interest rate hikes impact each financial firm?
(Market reactions and recovery speed)

5. How do these financial firms compare to the overall market (S&P 500)?
(Benchmarking performance)


Here were some responses about my idea:

Girlfriend
  My girlfriend was very supportive overall. She said she liked that I was exploring a project related to my future career goals. Since I’ve been talking about possibly working at Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan, she thought doing a financial firmfocused analysis was smart because it shows direction and purpose. Her main feedback was that she liked how this project connects to where I want to go professionally.


Uncle (Data Analytics Manager)
  My uncle gave me more technical and career focused feedback. He said projects that relate directly to companies you want to work for can be a huge advantage because they act almost like a “mini portfolio piece” tailored to that employer. He mentioned that when someone in analytics builds a project relevant to a company’s industry, hiring managers pay more attention because it shows initiative and proves you can do real work they care about. He also said that sometimes companies even use insights from student projects if they’re interesting enough. Overall, he told me this question was highly relevant, impressive, and very feasible.

Friend Asher (BYU student)
  My friend Asher said it was a solid idea and that finance datasets are usually easy to find and very up to date. He encouraged me to check that the data sources were reliable and that the variables would actually connect to the questions I want to answer. He thought the topic was strong as long as the data is clean and accessible.

Roommate
  My roommate thought a finance focused project made a ton of sense because he knows I’m trying to figure out where I want to work after graduation. He said comparing financial firms like JPMorgan and Goldman could actually help me see which one aligns better with my interests. He also thought the project could be useful for interviews since it shows I'm already thinking about the industry.



Based on this feedback, I decided to move forward with the bank performance project because it is feasible, aligns with my career goals, and provides data that can be analyzed clearly with the tools learned in this course.
